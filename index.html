  <p>There's something in the air </p>
  <p>The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses.</p>
  <p>With their masks off and it makes me so happy</p>
  <p>Larchmont Village smells like lilies of the valley </p>

  <p>Ever since I fell out of love with you, I fell back in love with me </p>
  <p>and boy, does it feel sweet, like a summer breeze</p>
  <p>Ever since I fell out of love with you, 
  <p>I fell back in love with the city,</p>
  <p>Like the Paramount sign sparkling, sparkling just for me. </p>

  <p>You made me trade my violets for roses </p>
  <p>You tried to take all the pink off my toes</p>
  <p>And God knows the only mistake that a man can make</p>
  <p>Is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses. </p>

  <p>You made me trade my violets for roses </p>
  <p>You tried to trade in my new truck for horses</p>
